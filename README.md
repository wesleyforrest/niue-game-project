# niue-game-project

Game designed and coded using skills learned on the nology 12 week course.

The brief was to create a game using vanilla JS to showcase the skills learned to-date on the course.

For my game, i chose to design a quiz with the basic functionality to utilise an external js file and extract data from this to populate the questions and answers.

My aim was to work on basic functionality first and then add in features to enhanace playability.

Additional features planned are

- Timer
- Score Counter
- Two player mode
- Page moves to next question on a correct answer being clicked or return to start on an incorrect answer
- Create cards for each question that flip once answered
